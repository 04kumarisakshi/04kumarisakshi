// Problem statement: Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.

// Examples
// Example 1:
// Input:
 
// n = 4, arr1[] = [1 4 8 10] 
// m = 5, arr2[] = [2 3 9]

// Output:
 
// arr1[] = [1 2 3 4]
// arr2[] = [8 9 10]

// Explanation:

// After merging the two non-decreasing arrays, we get, 1,2,3,4,8,9,10
